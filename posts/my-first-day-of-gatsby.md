Hi, my name is Fabio Tetsuo and welcome to my basic blog version!

So, in the last year, I researched about frameworks to develop a pretty static website for a client (also a friend of mine) and that was the first time I heard about Gatsby. I was pretty amazed by what I read it and I decided to learn a little bit more of the amazing open-source framework. So, I saw a Gatsby course in Udemy and I had the possibility to learn a lot in this course, it was amazing... And so, that's how I made a first contact with Gatsby.

And I can't lie, I'm becoming a huge Gatsby enthusiast! Since I heard about #100DaysOfGatsby (a little late, I confess), I decided to accept the challenge and I'm having so much fun learning and discovering new things everyday. I'm following the approach of go deep in the documentation, so I can understand the code details and I hope it works.

If you're seeing this post, it means that day 1 challenge was completed with success and at least fot the moment, my strategy is working fine.
